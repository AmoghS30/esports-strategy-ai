  "commentary": "T1 demonstrated exceptional macro play throughout the match. Early aggression from Lee Sin secured first blood at 2:45, setting the tone for the game. Despite JDG's attempt to control objectives with the early dragon, T1's superior team coordination became evident in the mid-game. The crucial Baron fight at 18:45 showcased Faker's legendary Orianna mechanics, landing a 4-man shockwave that turned the tide completely. The final team fight near dragon pit resulted in a clean ace, allowing T1 to push for the championship victory."
