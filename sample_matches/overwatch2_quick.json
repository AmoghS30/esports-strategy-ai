  "commentary": "This King's Row match was an absolute nail-biter that came down to literally one meter. San Francisco Shock attacked first, completing the map in 3:45 after a clutch overtime push. The Genji-Zarya-Ana combo proved devastating in teamfights.\n\nDynasty's attack started strong, capturing Point A even faster than Shock. Their Winston dive composition created chaos in Shock's backline, and it looked like they would complete with time to spare.\n\nHowever, Shock's defense at the second checkpoint was heroic. Multiple defensive stands slowed Dynasty's progress, though they eventually broke through. The final stretch became a desperate push as time ticked down.\n\nIn the final 30 seconds, Dynasty's payload was one meter—literally ONE METER—from the finish line when time expired. Shock's Reinhardt tanked the payload, refusing to let it move, while their DPS eliminated Dynasty's overtime touches.\n\nThis match showcases Overwatch 2 at its most intense—perfect ultimate combos, incredible individual mechanics, and teamwork under pressure. The 1-meter difference will haunt Dynasty, but demonstrates how every second matters in OW2."
