  "commentary": "This Champions League I war between Nova Esports and Tribe Gaming was an absolute nail-biter that came down to a single star difference. Both clans are considered among the world's best, and this war showcased why.\n\nThe war started evenly, with both clans efficiently clearing their bottom bases. The first major moment came at the 4-hour mark when Nova held a 5-star lead, but Tribe's Lenaide delivered a game-changing 3-star on Nova's #2 base - a base many thought was impossible to triple.\n\nNova's iTzu responded by attempting Tribe's #1 base but could only manage 2-stars at 87%. This missed 3-star would prove crucial. The war remained incredibly close, with scores tied or within 1-2 stars for most of the battle day.\n\nThe true turning point came at 36:45 when Nova's Judo Sloth made the strategic decision to 'dip' - attacking Tribe's #3 base (lower than his #4 position) to secure a guaranteed 3-star with Super Witch Smash. This attack showed Nova's tactical maturity - they were willing to sacrifice 'honor' (mirror hits) for guaranteed stars.\n\nAs the war entered its final hours, Nova led by just 1 star. Tribe pushed hard with their remaining attacks, but Nova's Klaus delivered the decisive blow - a perfect Blizzard Lalo 3-star on Tribe's #1 base using his second attack. This was the clutch performance Nova needed.\n\nThe final score of 45-44 stars (1 star difference, 27% destruction advantage) showcases how evenly matched these clans are. Nova's superior dip attack strategy and Klaus's heroics secured the win.\n\nKey Lessons:\n1. In close wars, strategic dip attacks for guaranteed stars > risking mirror fails\n2. Second attacks should target difficult bases, not just cleanup\n3. Destruction percentage matters for tiebreakers - every percent counts\n4. Root Rider and Super Witch strategies proved most consistent (100% success rates)\n5. Mental fortitude in final hours crucial - Klaus's pressure 3-star won the war\n\nThis war exemplifies top-tier Clash of Clans competitive play - perfect execution, strategic depth, and clutch performances under pressure."
