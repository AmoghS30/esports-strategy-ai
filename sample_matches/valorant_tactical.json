  "commentary": "This Haven map between Fnatic and Paper Rex showcased tactical Valorant at its finest. Fnatic started strong on attack, taking the first pistol and building a 7-5 halftime lead behind derke's exceptional Jett OP play.\n\nPaper Rex came alive in the second half, winning the pistol round and riding that momentum to a 9-7 lead. Jinggg's aggressive Raze play constantly caught Fnatic off-guard, and Paper Rex's coordinated site executes were nearly flawless.\n\nThe critical moment came at round 17 when Fnatic, down 7-9, called their final timeout. Whatever Boaster said worked—Fnatic won 5 of the next 6 rounds to close out the map 12-10.\n\nKey factors in Fnatic's victory: Leo's Sova utility control that consistently revealed PRX positions, Chronicle's Omen smokes that denied crucial retakes, and Alfajer's clutch plays in critical moments. Derke's 3k in the final round sealed the deal.\n\nPaper Rex showed why they're feared with their aggressive, unpredictable playstyle, but Fnatic's discipline and tactical adjustments proved superior in this match."
